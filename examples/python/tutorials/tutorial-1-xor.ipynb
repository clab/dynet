    "## Working with the python dyNET package\n",
    "\n",
    "The dyNET package is intended for neural-network processing on the CPU, and is particularly suited for NLP applications. It is a python-wrapper for the dyNET C++ package written by Chris Dyer.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two modes of operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Static networks__, in which a network is built and then being fed with different inputs/outputs. Most NN packages work this way.\n",
    "* __Dynamic networks__, in which a new network is built for each training example (sharing parameters with the networks of other training examples).  This approach is what makes dyNET unique, and where most of its power comes from.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will describe both of these modes."

    "### Package Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "The main piece of dyNET is the `ComputationGraph`, which is what essentially defines a neural network.\n",
    "The `ComputationGraph` is composed of expressions, which relate to the inputs and outputs of the network,\n",
    "as well as the `Parameters` of the network. The parameters are the things in the network that are optimized over time, and all of the parameters sit inside a `Model`. There are `trainers` (for example `SimpleSGDTrainer`) that are in charge of setting the parameter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not be using the `ComputationGraph` directly, but it is there in the background, as a singleton object.\n",
    "When `dynet` is imported, a new `ComputationGraph` is created. We can then reset the computation graph to a new state\n",
    "by calling `renew_cg()`.\n"

    "### Static Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The life-cycle of a dyNET program is:\n",
    "1. Create a `Model`, and populate it with `Parameters`.\n",
    "2. Renew the computation graph, and create `Expression` representing the network\n",
    "      (the network will include the `Expression`s for the `Parameters` defined in the model).\n",
    "3. Optimize the model for the objective of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider a model for solving the \"xor\" problem. The network has two inputs, which can be 0 or 1, and a single output which should be the xor of the two inputs.\n",
    "We will model this as a multi-layer perceptron with a single hidden node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x = x_1, x_2$ be our input. We will have a hidden layer of 8 nodes, and an output layer of a single node. The activation on the hidden layer will be a $\\tanh$. Our network will then be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sigma(V(\\tanh(Wx+b)))$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $W$ is a $8 \\times 2$ matrix, $V$ is an $8 \\times 1$ matrix, and $b$ is an 8-dim vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want the output to be either 0 or 1, so we take the output layer to be the logistic-sigmoid function, $\\sigma(x)$, that takes values between $-\\infty$ and $+\\infty$ and returns numbers in $[0,1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin by defining the model and the computation graph.\n"
